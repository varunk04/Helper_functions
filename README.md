# Helper_functions

This file contains functions that are commonly used in machine learning, imporing this file directly from the github or downloading and importing this file locally will avoid rewriting same piece of code again and again saving tons of time.

soem of the function that are included in this file are:
* Building a pretty confusion matrix
* unziping the file
* walking through the directory and lsiting all the files in that
* plotting loss curves(for neural networks)
* comparing two models hsitorys
* etc,etc..

example: 

from helper_functions import plot_loss_curves, confusion_matrix,unzip_data,walk_through_dir


**Note: I will be updating this file with new functions!**
